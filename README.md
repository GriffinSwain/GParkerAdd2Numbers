# GParkerAdd2Numbers
This program takes two user inputs and adds them together. It makes sure that the numbers are actually numbers then outputs the sum to the user. 
It allows the user to choose to restart the program or to end it.

# Peer Review By Harrison Busby: 

"Griffin did a great job on his code. I really liked how if you entered a letter instead of numbers, it wouldnt kick you completely out. His code is organized and well thought out. Great job Griffin!
